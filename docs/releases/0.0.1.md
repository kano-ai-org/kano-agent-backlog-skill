# 0.0.1 — Initial local-first backlog workflow (MVP)

This is the first public cut of the Kano Agent Backlog demo workspace: a local-first, file-based backlog that supports agent collaboration with an auditable trail.

No server runtime is included (by design).

## Highlights

- File-first backlog as the system of record under `_kano/backlog/` (items + decisions + views)
- Agent-friendly CLI to create/update items, enforce Ready-gate discipline, and keep views in sync
- Topics + Worksets to manage multi-session context and per-item scratch space
- Deterministic views (dashboards/reports) refreshable from canonical data

## What’s included

- Work items
  - Create/read and validate Ready-gate fields
  - Update state transitions with append-only Worklog entries
- Topics
  - Create topics and attach items/snippets/materials for shared exploration context
- Worksets
  - Initialize per-item working directories for deliverables and notes
- Views
  - Refresh dashboards/reports after changes to keep the backlog readable
- Auditability
  - Append-only Worklog patterns and CLI-driven changes for traceability
  - Worklog entries support `[agent=...]` and `[model=...]` attribution (defaults to `unknown` when not provided)

## Getting started

1. Install the skill (editable)
   - `python -m pip install -e skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill`
2. Check environment health
   - `python skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill/scripts/kano-backlog doctor --format plain`
3. Create a work item
   - `python skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill/scripts/kano-backlog workitem create --type task --title "..." --agent <agent> --product <product>`
4. Refresh views
   - `python skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill/scripts/kano-backlog view refresh --agent <agent> --product <product>`

## Known limitations (MVP)

- No server / MCP / HTTP runtime (local-first only)
- Vector backends / embeddings provider integrations are not implemented in this release
- Some workflows are intentionally minimal to keep the system deterministic and auditable

## Notes for agents

- Prefer running backlog operations through the `kano-backlog` CLI to preserve the audit trail.
- If the model name is unknown, record `unknown` (recommended over guessing).

# 0.0.2 — Topics system hardening + embedding pipeline foundations

This release focuses on two areas:
- **Topic system enhancements** to make multi-session, multi-agent context management reliable.
- **Embedding preprocessing + vector backend research foundations** to enable local-first semantic retrieval work in subsequent releases.

No server runtime is included (by design).

## Highlights

- Topics: templates/archetypes for consistent topic scaffolding
- Topics: cross-references (`related_topics`) with bidirectional linking
- Topics: snapshots (create/list/restore/cleanup) for safe checkpoints
- Topics: merge/split operations with history preservation and dry-run mode
- Embeddings: clarified requirements and decisions (cross-lingual retrieval; per-model indexes)
- Embeddings: deterministic chunking/token-budget contracts and vector backend adapter contract captured in backlog items

## Known limitations

- No server / MCP / HTTP runtime (local-first only)
- Embedding providers and benchmarking are still evolving; expect iteration and config churn
- Vector backend selection remains local-first and dependency-sensitive (Windows compatibility is a primary constraint)

# 0.0.3 — Config/Profiles hardening + effective-config artifacts + release gate stabilization

This release focuses on making the skill easier to operate deterministically:

- Profiles are treated as first-class overlays for pipeline experiments.
- Effective config artifacts are written to stable paths for audit/debug.
- Release check Phase2 (doctor + pytest + topic smoke) is stabilized and produces pinned reports.

No server runtime is included (by design).

## Highlights

- Profiles
  - `--profile` shorthand prefers `.kano/backlog_config/<ref>.toml` first.
  - Fallback for shorthand: `<repo_root>/<ref>.toml`.
  - Explicit paths still work (absolute, `./...`, or values ending in `.toml`).
- Effective config artifacts
  - Stable: `.kano/cache/effective_backlog_config.toml`
  - Runtime overrides: `.kano/cache/effective_runtime_backlog_config.toml`
- Env auto-load for local dev
  - Default: load `env/local.secrets.env` when present.
  - Override: `--env-file` or `KANO_ENV_FILE`.
  - Never overwrite an already-set environment variable.
- Embedding providers
  - Gemini embeddings via google-genai are supported (see profile `profiles/embedding/gemini-embedding-001.toml`).

## Release check evidence (demo workspace)

- `_kano/backlog/topics/release-0-0-3/publish/release_check_0.0.3_phase2.md`

## Migration notes (from 0.0.2)

- Config inspection artifacts moved from `.kano/debug/` to `.kano/cache/`.
- If you depend on secrets, prefer `env/local.secrets.env` (ignored) + env var templates (tracked).

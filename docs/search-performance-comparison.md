## Performance Benchmarks

### Test Environment

- **Repository:** kano-agent-backlog-skill-demo
- **Corpus Size:** 2,169 files, 26,857 chunks
- **Query:** "embed"
- **Hardware:** Standard development machine

### Results

| Approach | Time | Results | Ranked | Token Cost* | Use Case |
|----------|------|---------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Grep** | 1.7s | 309 lines | ❌ No | ~77k tokens | Quick dev lookup |
| **FTS5** | 3.0s | 20 chunks | ✅ BM25 | ~5k tokens | Keyword search |
| **Vector** | 60s† | 5 chunks | ✅ Semantic | ~1.2k tokens | Semantic search |
| **Hybrid** | 3.5s | 5 chunks | ✅ Best | ~1.2k tokens | **Production** |

*Token cost = average tokens needed to read all results  
†Full vector scan without FTS filtering

### Key Observations

1. **Grep is fastest** but returns unranked results (309 lines = information overload)
2. **FTS5 adds 1.3s overhead** but provides BM25 ranking (reduces results to 20 relevant chunks)
3. **Vector alone is 17x slower** than Hybrid due to full corpus scan
4. **Hybrid achieves best precision** (semantic ranking) with near-FTS speed

---

## Search Approaches Explained

### 1. Grep - Pattern Matching

**How it works:**
```bash
grep -r "embed" skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill/src/
```

**Process:**
1. Traverse every file (2,169 files)
2. Scan every line in each file
3. Output matching lines

**Complexity:** O(files × avg_file_size)

**Pros:**
- Fast for small repos
- No preprocessing needed
- Familiar to developers

**Cons:**
- No ranking (all results equal)
- No semantic understanding
- Cannot integrate with vector search
- Requires complex regex for advanced queries

---

### 2. FTS5 + BM25 - Ranked Keyword Search

**How it works:**
```sql
SELECT *, bm25(chunks_fts) AS score
FROM chunks_fts
WHERE chunks_fts MATCH 'embed'
ORDER BY score ASC
LIMIT 20
```

**Process:**
1. **Build Phase** (one-time):
   - Create inverted index: `"embed" → [chunk_1, chunk_5, chunk_9, ...]`
   - Store in SQLite FTS5 table

2. **Query Phase**:
   - Lookup index (O(log N) via B-tree)
   - Calculate BM25 score for each match
   - Return top-k ranked results

**Complexity:** O(log N) for lookup + O(M) for scoring (M = matches)

**Pros:**
- Fast lookup via inverted index
- BM25 ranking considers term frequency, rarity, and document length
- Supports complex queries (AND/OR/NOT/NEAR)
- Built-in snippet extraction with highlighting

**Cons:**
- No semantic understanding ("error handling" won't match "exception management")
- Requires preprocessing (index build)
- 3x slower than grep for simple queries

---

### 3. Vector Search - Semantic Similarity

**How it works:**
```python
# 1. Embed query
query_vector = embedder.embed("embed")  # → [0.023, -0.145, ..., 0.234]

# 2. Compare with all chunk vectors
for chunk in chunks:
    similarity = cosine_similarity(query_vector, chunk.vector)

# 3. Return top-k by similarity
```

**Process:**
1. **Build Phase** (one-time):
   - Embed all chunks using model (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)
   - Store vectors in database

2. **Query Phase**:
   - Embed query text
   - Calculate cosine similarity with all chunk vectors
   - Return top-k by similarity score

**Complexity:** O(N × D) where N = chunks, D = vector dimensions

**Pros:**
- Understands semantic similarity
- Finds conceptually related content without keyword match
- Language-agnostic (works across translations)

**Cons:**
- Slow for large corpora (26,857 vector comparisons)
- Requires embedding model (local or API)
- Higher memory usage (1536 floats per chunk)

---

### 4. Hybrid Search - Best of Both Worlds

**How it works:**
```
Query: "embed"
    ↓
FTS5 Stage (fast filter):
    → Find 200 chunks containing "embed" (BM25 ranked)
    → 0.05s
    ↓
Vector Stage (precise rerank):
    → Embed query
    → Calculate similarity for 200 candidates only
    → Return top-5 by semantic similarity
    → 0.5s
    ↓
Total: 0.55s (vs 60s for full vector scan)
```

**Process:**
1. Use FTS5 to quickly filter to candidate set (e.g., 200 chunks)
2. Use Vector to rerank candidates by semantic similarity
3. Return top-k from reranked results

**Complexity:** O(log N) + O(M × D) where M << N (e.g., 200 vs 26,857)

**Pros:**
- Near-FTS speed (100x faster than full vector scan)
- Vector-level precision (semantic understanding)
- Combines keyword matching with semantic ranking

**Cons:**
- Requires both FTS and Vector indices
- Two-stage complexity
- May miss semantically similar results not in FTS candidates

## BM25 Algorithm Deep Dive

### What is BM25?

**BM25** (Best Matching 25) is a probabilistic ranking function that scores documents based on query term relevance.

### Formula

```
BM25(D, Q) = Σ IDF(qi) × (f(qi, D) × (k1 + 1)) / (f(qi, D) + k1 × (1 - b + b × (|D| / avgdl)))
             qi∈Q
```

Where:
- `D` = document (chunk)
- `Q` = query
- `qi` = query term i
- `f(qi, D)` = term frequency of qi in D
- `|D|` = length of D
- `avgdl` = average document length
- `k1` = term frequency saturation parameter (default: 1.2)
- `b` = length normalization parameter (default: 0.75)

### Three Key Components

#### 1. Term Frequency (TF)

**Question:** How many times does this term appear in the chunk?

```python
# Chunk A: "embed embed embed vector"
TF("embed") = 3

# Chunk B: "implement embedding adapter"
TF("embed") = 1  # "embedding" stems to "embed"
```

**Logic:** More occurrences → higher relevance

**Saturation:** Diminishing returns (3 occurrences ≠ 3x score of 1 occurrence)

---

#### 2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

**Question:** How rare is this term across the entire corpus?

```python
# Corpus: 26,857 chunks

# "the" appears in 20,000 chunks
IDF("the") = log(26857 / 20000) = 0.29  # Low (common word)

# "embed" appears in 500 chunks
IDF("embed") = log(26857 / 500) = 3.99  # Medium

# "SQLiteVectorBackend" appears in 5 chunks
IDF("SQLiteVectorBackend") = log(26857 / 5) = 8.60  # High (rare term)
```

**Logic:** Rare terms have more discriminative power

**Why IDF matters:**
- Without IDF: "the the the the" would score high (meaningless)
- With IDF: Common words (the, is, a) get low weight, rare terms get high weight

---

#### 3. Length Normalization

**Question:** Should longer documents get higher scores just because they have more words?

```python
# Chunk A (short): "embed vector search" (3 words)
# Chunk B (long): "this is a very long document about many things including embed..." (100 words)

# Without normalization:
# Chunk B might score higher just because it has more words

# With normalization:
normalization = 1 - b + b × (|D| / avgdl)

# If chunk is longer than average → normalization > 1 → score penalized
# If chunk is shorter than average → normalization < 1 → score boosted
```

**Logic:** Prevent long documents from dominating results

---

### Worked Example

**Query:** "embed"

**Chunk A:**
```python
"embedder = resolve_embedder(embed_cfg)"
```
- Length: 5 words
- TF("embed") = 2 (embedder + embed_cfg)
- IDF("embed") = 3.99
- Normalization = 0.8 (shorter than average)

**BM25 Score:**
```
3.99 × (2 × 2.2) / (2 + 1.5 × 0.8) ≈ 6.8
```

---

**Chunk B:**
```python
"This module implements the embedding pipeline for vector search.
The embedder uses the embedding model to embed text chunks."
```
- Length: 18 words
- TF("embed") = 4 (embedding × 2 + embedder + embed)
- IDF("embed") = 3.99
- Normalization = 1.3 (longer than average)

**BM25 Score:**
```
3.99 × (4 × 2.2) / (4 + 1.5 × 1.3) ≈ 5.9
```

**Result:** Chunk A scores higher despite lower TF, because it's more concise.

---

**Chunk C:**
```python
"The system uses a database to store data."
```
- TF("embed") = 0
- **BM25 Score = 0** (no match)

---

### BM25 Parameters

```sql
-- Default: bm25(chunks_fts)
-- Custom: bm25(chunks_fts, k1, b)

SELECT bm25(chunks_fts, 1.5, 0.8) AS score
FROM chunks_fts
WHERE chunks_fts MATCH 'embed'
```

**k1 (TF saturation):**
- Higher k1 → TF has more impact (repeated terms matter more)
- Lower k1 → TF saturates faster (diminishing returns kick in sooner)
- Default: 1.2

**b (length normalization):**
- Higher b → stronger length penalty (long docs penalized more)
- Lower b → weaker length penalty (length matters less)
- Default: 0.75

---

### SQLite FTS5 Implementation

```sql
-- Get BM25 scores (lower = better in SQLite)
SELECT 
    content,
    bm25(chunks_fts) AS score  -- Negative scores (more negative = more relevant)
FROM chunks_fts
WHERE chunks_fts MATCH 'embed'
ORDER BY score ASC  -- Ascending order (most negative first)
LIMIT 20
```

**Why "lower is better"?**
- SQLite FTS5 returns negative BM25 scores
- More relevant → more negative → lower numerical value
- Use `ORDER BY score ASC` to get best matches first

---

## When to Use Each Approach

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Developer ad-hoc lookup** | Grep | Fastest, no setup needed |
| **User-facing search** | Hybrid | Best precision + speed |
| **AI agent code search** | Hybrid | Minimizes token consumption |
| **Exact string match** | Grep | No need for ranking |
| **Keyword + ranking** | FTS5 | Fast + BM25 relevance |
| **Semantic similarity** | Vector | Understands meaning |
| **Large corpus (>10k files)** | Hybrid | Vector alone too slow |
| **Small corpus (<100 files)** | Grep or FTS5 | Overhead not worth it |

---

### Use Case Examples

#### 1. Developer Quick Lookup
```bash
# "Where is this function defined?"
grep -r "def search_hybrid" src/
```
**Why Grep:** One-time query, just need location, no ranking needed.

---

#### 2. User Search Interface
```python
# User types: "how to implement custom embedding"
results = search_hybrid(
    query="how to implement custom embedding",
    corpus="repo",
    fts_k=200,
    top_k=10
)
```
**Why Hybrid:** Users expect ranked results, semantic understanding helps.

---

#### 3. AI Agent Code Retrieval
```python
# Agent needs context for: "Fix the vector search bug"
# Without Hybrid: Agent reads 309 grep results (77k tokens)
# With Hybrid: Agent reads top 5 semantic matches (1.2k tokens)
# Token savings: 98%
```
**Why Hybrid:** Minimizes token cost while maximizing relevance.

---

#### 4. Complex Query
```sql
-- "Find chunks about embedding but not tests"
WHERE chunks_fts MATCH 'embed* NOT test'
```
**Why FTS5:** Supports boolean operators, grep requires complex pipes.

## Recommendations

### For Production Systems

1. **Always use Hybrid** for user-facing search
2. **Build indices incrementally** (don't rebuild from scratch)
3. **Monitor FTS candidate count** (if too low, increase `fts_k`)
4. **Tune BM25 parameters** based on corpus characteristics
5. **Cache vector embeddings** (don't re-embed same queries)

### For Development

1. **Use Grep** for quick ad-hoc lookups
2. **Use FTS5** when you need ranked results
3. **Use Hybrid** when building features that consume search results

### For AI Agents

1. **Always use Hybrid** to minimize token consumption
2. **Adjust `top_k`** based on context window size
3. **Use FTS for filtering** (e.g., "only Python files")
4. **Use Vector for ranking** (semantic relevance)

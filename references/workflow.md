# Workflow SOP

## A) Planning (discussion -> tickets)

### Pre-planning: Sync DB sequences

Before creating any work items, ensure the DB sequence is synchronized:

```bash
# Sync sequences from filesystem to DB
kano-backlog admin sync-sequences --product <product>
```

**When to sync**:
- After cloning the repository
- After pulling changes that add/remove items
- When seeing "Ambiguous item reference" errors
- Before bulk item creation

### Planning workflow

1. Create or update Epic for the milestone.
2. Split into Features (capabilities).
3. Split into UserStories (user perspective).
4. Split into Tasks/Bugs (single focused coding sessions).
5. Fill Ready gate sections for each Task/Bug.
6. Append Worklog entry: "Created from discussion: ..." (scripts require `--agent`).

## B) Ready gate

The Ready gate ensures planning is complete before execution begins.

**Required Fields** (Task/Bug):
- **Context**: Why are we doing this? What is the background?
- **Goal**: What is the specific objective?
- **Approach**: How will we solve it? (Steps, design choices)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know it's done? (Checklist)
- **Risks / Dependencies**: What could go wrong? What do we need first?

**Validation Points**:
1. **State Transition**: Moving to `InProgress` triggers automatic validation.
   - Checks item's required fields.
   - Checks parent's required fields (if parent is not null).
   - Blocks transition if validation fails.
   - Use `--force` to bypass (emergency only; records warning).
2. **Item Creation**: Creating a child item triggers parent validation.
   - Checks if parent is Ready.
   - Blocks creation if parent is not Ready.
   - Use `--force` to bypass.
3. **Manual Check**: `item check-ready <ID>` validates item and parent.

**Best Practices**:
- **Parent: null**: Allowed for standalone tasks, top-level Epics, or hotfixes where hierarchy is overkill.
- **--force**: Use sparingly for hotfixes or when requirements are truly emergent.
- **Validation**: Always run `check-ready` before starting work.

## C) Execution

1. Set state to InProgress.
2. Append Worklog for important decisions or changes.
3. If a decision is architectural, create ADR and link it:
   - Add ADR id to item `decisions: []`
   - Append Worklog entry referencing the ADR

### Conflict Guard

- **Owner Locking**: Items in `InProgress` are locked to their owner.
- **Auto-Assignment**: When moving to `InProgress`, if no owner is set, you become the owner.
- **Collaboration**: To hand off work, the current owner must change the owner field or move the item out of `InProgress` (e.g. to `Review` or `Planned`).

## D) Completion

1. Move state to Review -> Done.
2. Append a Worklog summary with:
   - What changed
   - Related items and ADRs

## D.1) Parent sync (forward-only)

- When a child state changes, parents can be auto-advanced forward-only.
- Parent edits never force child states.
- Use `--no-sync-parent` if you need to keep parent state unchanged for a manual re-plan.

## E) Scope change

- Do not rewrite a ticket into a different task.
- Split into a new ticket and link via `links.relates`.
- Append a Worklog entry explaining the split.

## F) File operations

- Use `scripts/backlog/*` or `scripts/fs/*` for backlog/skill artifacts.
- Scripts only operate under `_kano/backlog/` or `_kano/backlog_sandbox/` to keep audit logs clean.

## F.1) ID management best practices

### Always use system-allocated IDs

**Correct**:
```bash
# Let the system allocate the next ID
kano-backlog item create --type task --title "..." --agent <agent> --product <product>
# Output: OK: Created: KABSD-TSK-0340
```

**Incorrect**:
```yaml
# DON'T manually edit frontmatter to assign IDs
id: KABSD-TSK-9999  # ❌ Will cause collisions
```

### Reference items by UID when ambiguous

**Correct**:
```bash
# Use UID to avoid ambiguity
kano-backlog item update-state 019c11e6-de87-7218-b89b-38c2e4e9cabd \
  --state Done --agent <agent> --product <product>
```

**Incorrect**:
```bash
# Display ID may be ambiguous if duplicates exist
kano-backlog item update-state KABSD-TSK-0001 --state Done ...
# Error: Ambiguous item reference 'KABSD-TSK-0001': 2 matches
```

### Use trash command, never delete directly

**Correct**:
```bash
# Move to _trash/ (recoverable)
kano-backlog admin items trash <UID> \
  --agent <agent> \
  --reason "Duplicate/incorrect item" \
  --product <product> \
  --apply
```

**Incorrect**:
```bash
# DON'T delete files directly
rm _kano/backlog/products/<product>/items/task/0000/KABSD-TSK-0001_*.md  # ❌
```

### Periodic health checks

Run these commands periodically:

```bash
# Check DB sequence health
kano-backlog doctor --product <product>

# Validate UID uniqueness
kano-backlog admin validate uids --product <product>

# Sync sequences if needed
kano-backlog admin sync-sequences --product <product>
```

## G) Artifacts directory

Store work outputs in `_kano/backlog/products/<product>/artifacts/<item-id>/`:

**What to store**:
- Demo reports (e.g., `DEMO_REPORT_*.md`)
- Implementation summaries (e.g., `*_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- Analysis documents and investigation results
- Test results and benchmark data
- Generated diagrams and visualizations
- Exported data or intermediate build artifacts

**Why**:
- **Traceability**: Artifacts are directly linked to the work item that produced them
- **Context**: All outputs related to a specific Epic/Feature/Task are co-located
- **Archival**: When an item is completed, all related artifacts are preserved together
- **Discovery**: Easy to find outputs by navigating to the item's artifacts directory

**Example**:
```
artifacts/
├── KABSD-EPIC-0003/
│   ├── DEMO_REPORT_0.0.2_FINAL_SUCCESS.md
│   ├── UID_VALIDATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
│   └── benchmark_results.json
└── KABSD-TSK-0123/
    ├── analysis.md
    └── diagram.png
```

**Note**: Do not store artifacts in repo root or scattered locations; always use the structured artifacts directory.
